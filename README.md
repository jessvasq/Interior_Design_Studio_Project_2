## User Stories

- As a user I want to land on a page where I’m able to see/select different interior design styles 
-Once I select a style, I want to see interior design ideas specific to the style I selected
-When selecting an image/idea, I want to be redirected to a new page where I can see the product’s details from the image selected 
- If I like one of the products, I want to add the product to my personalized page called (‘My studio page’)
- As a user I want to edit, delete and add a new product in “my studio page”
- All these pages should have a button that will redirect me to the main page, in case I want to look at other styles/products.
